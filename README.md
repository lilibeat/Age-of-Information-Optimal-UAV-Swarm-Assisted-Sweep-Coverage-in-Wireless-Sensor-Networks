# How to run?
> The proposed algorithm can be divided into three parts. The first is about the clustering of POIs, i.e., Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2; the second part is about the sweep coverage algorithm in simultaneous sweep mode, i.e., Algorithm 3; and the third part is about the sweep coverage algorithm in batch sweep mode, i.e., Algorithm 4. Regarding the code run, first load the POI scenario(see POI Scenario 1-POI Scenario 5), then run either Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 to get the clustering of the POIs, and then run either Algorithm 3 or Algorithm 4. In addition, in Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4, the imbo_route function is called to plan the UAV swarmâ€™s sweep path.
